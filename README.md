# ParticleEditor
The ParticleEditor is an iOS app that helps design and immediately test various particle effects created using the [CoreAnimation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore) particle system.
The app uses SwiftUI and provides a convenient and compact user interface to modify the properties of the [CAEmitterLayer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/caemitterlayer) and instantly see how the changes impact the particle emitter.
